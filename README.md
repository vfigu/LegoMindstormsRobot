# Python Lego Mindstorms Robot
## COMP 598 Embedded Applications, CSUN Spring 2018
•	Embedded Applications project using Python programming to implement target finding and obstacle avoidance.  
•	This 4-wheeled bot uses a light sensor to find a target on the ground and both an ultrasonic sensor and touch sensor for obstacle avoidance; wields a small hammer triggered by sensors as a defense mode when target is found.
